<p>Playing sports helps us stay in shape, teaches us how to organize our time, boosts friendships, and builds relationships with our peers and adults. Through athletics, we gain skills that can best be acquired on a court, track, or field.</p>
<p>Participating in sports helps build leadership skills. Sports teams gives us an opportunity to surround ourself with competitive people and role models, and learn from them both.</p>
<p>Sports force us to organize our time so that we can both go to practice and finish our homework. The key is finding a balance. If we can learn to organize our time then we can succeed in both.</p>
