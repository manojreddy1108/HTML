<p>It’s no secret that reading books can be incredibly beneficial.  Books have the power to change lives, open minds, and teach new things.  But many people don’t realize just how life-changing reading books can be.</p>
<p>Many employers are looking for people with soft skills, such as communicating clearly. Benefits of reading books include exposing the reader to new words directly from the read context, increasing your soft skills.</p>
<p>Reading books can help you escape your world and experience the fictional adventures of the characters. At the same time, reading self-help books can allow patients with depression to better understand themselves and their symptoms and the issues they are facing. </p>
