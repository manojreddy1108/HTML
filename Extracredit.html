                <p>Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Qualities required :</h4>
				<ol type="1">
				  <li><b>Sportsmanship </b> : Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.
                    Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake.
                  </li>
				  <li><b>Violence</b> : Violence in sports involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration.</li>
				  <li><b>Emotions</b> : Another important aspect of the experience of sports is emotion, the feelings that reflect athletes’ self-evaluation or expectation of their performance and their perception of others’ evaluations and expectations. Some of the feelings expressed are anticipatory, prior to performing. Pregame “butterflies in the stomach” are as familiar to an athlete as stage fright is to an actor. Other feelings occur during and after the performance. All these feelings are “scripted” by the subculture of the sport in question. These scripts, or “feeling rules,” guide athletes as they manage their emotions, prompting, for instance, appropriate behaviour during pregame renditions of national anthems or during postgame victory celebrations.</li>
			    </ol>

				<p>Sports is good for our physical health and maintaining mental stability. It also builds physical fitness, confidence and boost our ability towards any work. It also gives refreshment for the people who are in any trouble or stress or anxiety.</p>
	            <p>Playing sports can develop teamwork skills in every person. Meanwhile, Sports also teaches us how to work with others and learn how to utilize different players strengths and weakness. By winning or losing in sports, we will develop ways to manage highs and lows in our life. </p>

        <h2>Types of Sports</h2>

				<h2>Indoor Games</h2>
				<aside>
					<img src="Indoor Games.jpg" width="350" height="250">
					<br>
				</aside>
				<p>Indoor games and sports are a variety of structured games or competitive physical exercises, typically carried out either at home, in a well-sheltered building, or in a specially constructed sport venue such as a gym, a natatorium, an arena or a roofed stadium.</p>
				<p><b>Some of the Indoor games are:</b></p>
				<p><b>Card Games:</b><br>
				    Most card games are played with a pack of 52 playing cards, which are divided equally into four suits: spades, clubs, hearts and diamonds. Each suit has the numbers 2 to 10 followed by the picture cards – Jack, Queen and King – and the ace with a single pip. In some games the ace is treated as a 1, in others as better than a king. In English language packs, the picture cards are marked J, Q, K and the ace A.</p>
				<p><b>Board Games:</b><br>
					Many different kinds of board games are played throughout the world, and many of them have been popular for hundreds of years. A few board games are decided by chance or luck alone, but most require some amount of skill on the part of the players. Games of pure chance are usually ‘race’ games, such as the children’s game snakes and ladders which was invented by Jaques. The winner – the player who reaches a certain square first – is decided by throwing numbered dice, over which the players have no control.</p>
				<p><b>Table-top Games:</b><br>
					Various indoor games, including billiards, snooker and pool, are played on a large, flat, cloth-covered table with six pockets. In these games, each of the two players tries to pot the balls (knock them into the pockets) by striking them with a cue-ball, which is hit with the tip of a stick called a cue.
					The winner is the player who reaches an agreed score first, or who has the highest score after a certain time.
